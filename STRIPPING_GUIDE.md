3. **Components** - Keep generic UI, remove business-specific
4. **Sidebar** - Update navigation for generic app

### Phase 2: Backend Cleanup  
1. **index.js** - Remove CrediYa endpoints, keep auth/user management
2. **schema.sql** - Keep foundation tables, remove business-specific

### Phase 3: Generic Foundation
1. **Create Generic Dashboard** - Remove financial widgets
2. **Generic User Management** - Keep role-based permissions
3. **Generic Settings** - Company/organization setup
4. **Generic Reporting Framework** - Empty but extensible
